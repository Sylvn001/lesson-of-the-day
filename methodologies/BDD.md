### Behavior Driven Development

## Whats is BDD -

> What is BDD? You may know the acronym for “Behavior Driven Development”. BDD is a methodology where your objective is based on the behavior of your application. In practice, BDD is a complement to TDD (TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT). This is because TDD proposes the development of tests before defining the code. While in BDD, we have a description of how the functionality should behave instead of saying what should be done technically. This enables greater knowledge about the product to be developed, raising doubts such as

- What to test
- How to name the tests
- How to understand why a test fails
- Where to start

> BDD uses scenarios in three blocks to facilitate communication between the team.

- GIVEN: Given a given context, preconditions for running the test...
- WHEN: Defines the action that will be performed on the system when something occurs
- THEN: expect something and THEN define the expected result

BDD has greater interaction between areas, what we call three-friend interaction, that is, three agents interact to create a product. Product Owner, Quality Analyst, Developer. Therefore, obtaining better results in the description of the tests. The focus is not on programming details, but on its behavior from the point of view of other areas, reducing internal communication gaps.

We can summarize that BDD works to define how a demand reaches the developer, integrate different areas of the company and think from the point of view of the expected behavior of a functionality by the user.

TDD guarantees that you always develop with 100% test coverage in mind, improve what needs to be done and never write a line of code without first thinking about how to guarantee that it will work.

Therefore, both can and should be implemented together, ensuring an efficient process when developing software.
