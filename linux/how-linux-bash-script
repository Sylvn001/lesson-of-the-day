# Bash script linux - how create and use 

Open a folder and make a file with `.sh` extension
nano (or touch) `nano hello_world.sh`

the first line in every .bash script is `#!/bin/bash`
`use # to create a optional comment with the explaination of what the command does`

Finally, use the command `echo "Hello, World!`. This command will print in terminal the word "Hello, World!"

in nano, you can save with the CTRL+X keyboard shortcut. 

### Give the script executable permissions

`./hello_world.sh`

The output of the command should be "Hello, World!"

you can create any useful scripts with `.sh` for automatization
